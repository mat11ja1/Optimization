In order to avoid having to use any derivatives we decided to use the Golden section line search method. When implementing the GS algorithm the largest problem is to find a good initial interval in which to do the line search. As we do not want to miss the minimum we started by always using a very large initial interval and depending on if we could evaluate the function at the end points.
